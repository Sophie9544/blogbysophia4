Many organizations prefer the virtual version, which provides the same functionality without extra hardware costs and allows deployment on existing virtual infrastructure. Using a virtual appliance also simplifies backup and recovery, ensuring minimal disruption in case of system issues.

**System Components and Capabilities**

The Wallix system consists of Bastion software and Access Manager (AM) software.

Access Manager provides tools for centralized role assignment, real time monitoring of network events, and advanced access controls.

It consolidates incoming communications into a single gateway, supports multiple authentication methods, and enables comprehensive auditing, including session recording with searchable metadata.
